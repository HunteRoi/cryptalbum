## Overview
CryptAlbum is an end-to-end encrypted gallery of photos. You can access it from any device you want and store your photos safely to share to your friends and family.

<img src="/docs/assets/overview.gif" alt="overview" />

## How it works
It is recommended to read the [documentation](./docs/) for more insight on the topic.

**If you want the PDF version of the docs, you can download the latest one [by clicking here](../-/jobs/artifacts/main/download?job=convert_to_pdf).**
If needed, you can also head to [the artifacts section](../../../-/main/artifacts) to view all previous versions.

## Getting Started
The first step is basically to clone the repository (`git clone`). Once this is done, you have a few configuration steps to achieve.

### Production
‚ö†Ô∏è The production target is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

Whenever it is to execute it on your own machine or on a server, for production, we recommend that you execute the setup script with the command `./setup.sh`.

The script will lead you through a few steps described herebelow.
The main purpose is for all the require dependencies and packages to be installed if not already present on your machine.
You will also be prompted to enter credentials for Minio and PostgreSQL. Those will be used to configure your environment.

1. The script will ask you if you agree to update your `/etc/host`. This action is to append the redirections from the following local domains:

   - `127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal`
   - `127.0.0.1 seq.local`
   - `127.0.0.1 minio.local`
   - `127.0.0.1 cryptalbum.local`

2. You will also be asked for the `Minio Access Key` and `Minio Secret Key`.

   - Open your browser to [https://minio.local/access-keys](https://minio.local/access-keys).
   - You will have to authenticate with the credentials you provided to the script.
   - Press the button `Create access key` and then the button `Create`.
   - Afterwards, your `Access Key` and `Secret Key` will be shown to you. **Don't forget to copy it!**

3. You will then be asked the `Seq API key`.

   - This time, head over to [https://seq.local/#/settings/api-keys](https://seq.local/#/settings/api-keys).
   - Press the button `ADD API KEY`.
   - For basic installation, you just have to add a `title` and press `Save Changes`.
   - You will get a popup with your key. **Don't forget to copy it!**

4. Everything is setup and the app will now compile! It might take some time, better get some tea or coffee in the meantime üçµ

5. Once available, you can access the website on [https://cryptalbum.local/](https://cryptalbum.local/).

### Development

#### Prerequisites
1. Install and start Docker (you can use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if you are on Windows).

2. Type `cp .minio.env.example .minio.env` to create a `.minio.env` file from the [example](.env.minio.example) available on the repo **and update the keys accordingly**:

   - `MINIO_ROOT_USER` is the account's name ;
   - `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` is the account's password.

3. Type `cp .postgres.env.example .postgres.env` to create a `.postgres.env` file from the [example](.env.postgres.example) available on the repo **and update the keys accordingly**:

   - `POSTGRES_USER` is the database user name ;
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is the database user's password ;
   - `POSTGRES_DB` is the database name.

4. Type `cp .env.example .env` to create a `.env` file from the [example](.env.example) available on the repository **and update the keys accordingly**.

5. Run the [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) script to build all the containers needed for the application to run.

In a development phase, you will need to set the following keys:

You will then need to follow these steps:

1. Download the dependencies with `yarn install`.
2. Push the database schema with `yarn db:push`.
3. Run the project startup script with `yarn dev`.
